<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
<p>I envision a future where technology becomes a bridge that solves real problems and empowers everyday people. Currently, I am gaining hands-on experience during my internship at the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), where I am learning how IT systems support large-scale operations, service delivery, and data management. This experience has strengthened my passion for building reliable, user-centered digital solutions.

One of my biggest aspirations is to develop an all-in-one business software — a platform that will streamline daily operations, from sales and inventory to customer management and analytics. I want to create a system that is affordable, simple to use, and truly transformative for small and medium-sized businesses across Kenya and beyond.

Academically, I dream of completing my degree with a Second Class Upper Honours or higher. Achieving this distinction is part of my personal commitment to discipline, growth, and excellence.

In the long run, I hope to establish my own tech firm, a space dedicated to innovation, mentorship, and solving African challenges through modern technology. I want to contribute meaningful solutions while creating opportunities for young developers who share the same vision.</p>
