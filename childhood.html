<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p>Growing up in Umoja, Eastlands, meant living in a place where neighbours felt like extended family. Our home wasn’t luxurious, but it was always full of warmth, noise, and the smell of evening chapatis drifting from outside kitchens.</p>

<h3>Family & Values</h3>
<p>We were raised in a family that valued togetherness, respect, and simple joys. Weekends often meant helping with small chores, running to the shop for milk, or sitting outside on the balcony listening to their parents talk about life. Evenings were full of laughter — siblings teasing each other, parents sharing stories, and neighbours popping in “kuuliza tu kama maji imekuja.”

Traditions were simple but meaningful:

<OL>Saturday church followed by chips mwitu on the way home
</OL>


<OL>Evening family meals where everyone had to sit together</OL>


<OL>Sharing whatever little they had with neighbours</OL>

<BR></BR>

From this environment, I learned humility, gratitude, and the importance of treating people well, regardless of their background.</p>

<h3>Formative Moments</h3>
<p>Life in Umoja was never boring. The open fields, estate corridors, and dusty roads became the playgrounds where imagination thrived.

One of the most formative memories was participating in the estate holiday tournaments — football matches that brought together kids from different courts. Our team rarely won, but the excitement of cheering, arguing about penalties, and celebrating small victories created lasting confidence and joy.

There were also school moments that shaped us. A class teacher once praised my drawing during an art lesson — a small success, but one that made me feel seen and encouraged my creativity.

I still remember helping a neighbour carry groceries upstairs or volunteering at church events, moments that taught responsibility and kindness.

Growing up in Umoja wasn’t about having everything — it was about making the most of what we had, finding adventure in everyday life, and being surrounded by people who truly shaped what we would become.</p>
